==== General ====

- Bindings Makefile to make all binaries and maybe easy publish new versions ?
- Revision / beta / alpha versions?
- make available on github
- mailing list
- homepage -> git

==== Common ====
- auto scaling.
  - -> Bindings.
- check whether cover/solution is correct
- Documentation, example
- Change Ad-hoc matrix formats
- Sparse Matrix formats

==== JAVA ====

- Documentation
- Warn more about thread safety in docs
- GUI
- read/write/cover/solution: bind, documentation, testing
- catch InterruptedException in train/select/test and stop worker threads?
- CUDA?
- smldata: download, split
- include banana-*, reg-1d
- more Junit tests
- check delete[] as in R (and common/main.cpp)

==== MATLAB ====

- Documentation
- make banana categorical
- read/write/cover/solution: documentation, testing
- Constructor with Filename
- smldata: class, load, download, split
- with smldata: automagical test
- make autoTrainSelect optionally disabled
- more unittest
- CUDA?

==== Python ====

- Documentation
- Sanity check about no training data?
- read/write: bind, documentation, testing
- smldata: download, split
- MacOS disable 32bit compilation
- Windows: case insensitive configuration?
- unittest
- scikit-learn compatibility
- real bindings?
  - cover/solution
- CUDA: Maybe like https://github.com/AaronParsons/aipy_cuda/blob/master/setup.py ??
- check delete[] as in R (and common/main.cpp)

==== Command line utilities ====
- make them usable from any directory
- make Configuration possible on command line
- autoscale?
