// This header provides the class Tcv_control that controls the behavior of Tcv_manager.
// 
// select method
// Determines the method for determining the hyper-parameters. Allowed values are in the range of SELECT_METHODS.
// SELECT_ON_ENTIRE_TRAIN_SET: Compute the average over the folds and pick best parameters
// SELECT_ON_EACH_FOLD: Pick best parameters for each fold separately
// 
// npl
// Flag indicating, whether the hyper-parameters are chosen according to the Neyman-Pearson-Learning (NPL) scenario 
// 
// npl_class
// The NPL class, the constraint is enforced on. This only applies if the flag npl is true
// 
// npl_constraint
// The constraint that is enforced on the npl_class. This only applies if the flag npl is true
// 
// weight_number
// If weight_number > 1, only the weights at the position = weight_number in the grid are considered.
// Here the weights are numbered from 1 to the number of weights.
// 
// fold_manager
// The fold_manager object used to construct the training and validation sets during cross validation.
// 
// grid_control
// The grid_control object used to generate the grid.
